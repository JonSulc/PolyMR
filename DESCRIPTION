Title: Model Non-Linear Causal Effects Through Polynomial Regression
Version: 2.0
Author: Jonathan Sulc
Maintainer: Jonathan Sulc <jonsulc@gmail.com>
Description: Uses a control function-based approach to model non-linear causal
    effects of an exposure on an outcome. The exposure is modeled linearly
    from instrumental variables (i.e. genotypes), the control function of which
    is used along with the exposure to model the outcome using polynomial
    regression.
